// From the frontend part i need to grab some data and send it to server just like we do in a regular application using axios or fetch
// But here is a problem: 
// In the recent version of nextjs everything is server component 
// and server component dont have access to anything that is on the frontend side, it is on server

// Anything thats on the server side needs can access everything on the server side (file sytem or anything thats on the sever side)
// Anything thats on the frontend part - useEffect, useState, Windows location, the url, anything on the page thats on the client side and you have to expicitly 
// make your application as a client side. "use client" is the way.

// Hint

// Most of the things in the api folder are on the backend side
// But anything outside is not always but usually a client component.

// In this case we want to take data from the signup form and send it to backend


// In nextjs request response is little bit different from expressjs


// All the console.log() inside "use client" files will appear in browser
// All the console.log() inside api folder will appear in terminal.

// Middleware in nextsj are quite different.


// can keep userModel as .ts also, but nothing sensitive is happening in this so kept it .js

// In case of nextjs, there is a special way how we export models from moongose.
// because there are chances that the model might have created in the database.
// In most of the cases in expressjs the model file doesnt run again and again automatically.
// but here we need to handle if it is already created or not.
